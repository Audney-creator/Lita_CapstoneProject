# Lita_CapstoneProject
This is where i documented my Second project given to me by The Incubator Hub 

## Project Title: Capstone Project 
## Sales Data
## Project Overview
---
In this project, i was tasked with analyzing the sales performance of a retail store. 
To explore sales data to uncover key insights such as top-selling products, regional 
performance, and monthly sales trends. The goal was to produce an interactive Power BI 
dashboard that highlights these findings.

## Technologies Used
---
- Microsoft Excel;
  - data loading and inspection
  - handling duplicates
  - For initial data exploration and calculations
  - data cleaning and formatting
  - data visualizations

- SQL: For querying data to derive key insights

- Power BI: For creating an interactive dashboard to visualize the findings

## Project Objectives
---
- 1. Excel:

     - Conducted exploratory analysis on the sales dataset.

     - Summarized total sales by product, region, and month using pivot tables.

     - Calculated metrics such as average sales per product and total revenue by region.

     - Generated reports using charts, to highlight trends and insight.

- 2. SQL:

    * Loaded the dataset into a SQL Server environment to extract the following insights:

    - Retrieved total sales for each product category.

    - Determined the number of sales transactions by region.

    - Identified the highest-selling product by total sales value.

    - Calculated total revenue per product.

    - Generated monthly sales totals for the current year.

    - Found the top 5 customers by total purchase amount.

    - Calculated the percentage of total sales contributed by each region.

    - Identified products with no sales in the last quarter.

- 3. Power BI:

    - Created an interactive dashboard that visualizes insights from Excel and SQL analysis.

    - Included an overall sales overview, top-performing products, and regional breakdowns.
 
 ## Data

The dataset used in this project was structured and contained fields such as 
- Order ID,
- Customer ID,
- Product,
- Region,
- Order date,
- Quantity,
- and Unit price.
During the initial analysis, there appeared to be repeated records; however, each record had a unique customer ID. After reviewing the data, I determined that these were valid entries representing unique customer transactions, so no duplicate removal was necessary.
