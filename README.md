This is where i documented my Second project given to me by The Incubator Hub 

## Project Title: Capstone Project 
## Sales Data
## Project Overview
---
In this project, i was tasked with analyzing the sales performance of a retail store. 
To explore sales data to uncover key insights such as top-selling products, regional 
performance, and monthly sales trends. The goal was to produce an interactive Power BI 
dashboard that highlights these findings.

## Technologies Used
---
- Microsoft Excel: For initial data exploration and calculations

- SQL: For querying data to derive key insights

- Power BI: For creating an interactive dashboard to visualize the findings

## Project Objectives

- 1. Excel:

     - Conducted exploratory analysis on the sales dataset.

     - Summarized total sales by product, region, and month using pivot tables.

     - Calculated metrics such as average sales per product and total revenue by region.

     - Generated reports using charts, to highlight trends and insight.

- 2. SQL:

    * Load the dataset into a SQL Server environment to extract the following insights:

    - Retrieve total sales for each product category.

    - Determine the number of sales transactions by region.

    - Identify the highest-selling product by total sales value.

    - Calculate total revenue per product.

    - Generate monthly sales totals for the current year.

    - Find the top 5 customers by total purchase amount.

    - Calculate the percentage of total sales contributed by each region.

    - Identify products with no sales in the last quarter.

- 3. Power BI:

    - Create an interactive dashboard that visualizes insights from Excel and SQL analyses.

    - Include an overall sales overview, top-performing products, and regional breakdowns.
